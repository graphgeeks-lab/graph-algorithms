# Contributing

We welcome contributions from everyone. By contributing to this repository, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repository and then **clone** it to your local machine using the following command:

    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:your-username/graph-algorithms.git
    ```

2. Create a new branch for your changes. Use a naming convention that reflects the purpose of the branch. For example:
    * `add_XXX` for adding new algorithms or data structures.
    * `fix_XXX` for fixing bugs in existing algorithms or data structures.
    * `test_XXX` for adding tests.
    * `doc_XXX` for updating or adding documentation.

## How to Contribute

You can contribute in several ways:

- Implementing new algorithms and adding them to the appropriate section (e.g., `array`, `dp`). If the algorithm does not fit into an existing section, create a new one. Ensure your implementation is functional.
- Optimizing or improving existing algorithms.
- Providing alternative solutions to problems.
- Identifying and fixing bugs.
- Adding examples to explain algorithms more clearly.
- Adding test cases to validate algorithms.
- Enhancing documentation.

## Pull Requests

1. Push your changes to your forked repository.
2. Submit a pull request (PR) to the main repository.

We will review your PR and may suggest changes or improvements. Here are some tips to increase the chances of your PR being accepted:

- Write clean and understandable code.
- Add comments and brief explanations of the algorithm in the code's docstrings.
- Provide a minimal example to explain the output.
- Include test cases for your algorithm.
- Write clear and concise commit messages.

## Issues

If you encounter a bug or have an idea for an algorithm to add, please submit a [new issue](https://github.com/your-username/graph-algorithms/issues). Before submitting a new issue, check the [existing issues](https://github.com/your-username/graph-algorithms/issues) to avoid duplicates. Additionally, consider contributing to discussions or resolving current issues.
